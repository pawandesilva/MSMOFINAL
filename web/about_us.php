                        <h2 class="text-center" style="color: #A79277">Our Mission</h2>
                        <p>To be recognized as the best organic food manufacturer & exporter and achieve superior & sustainable value for our stakeholders through strong resources, attentive customer care, and dynamic marketing.</p>

                        <h2 class="text-center container-fluid" style="color: #A79277">Who We Are</h2>
                        <p>MAL Organic, a company born not out of necessity, but out of desire to do something worthwhile, to be authentic, to be true to the most treasured aspect of any business, The Customers.</p>

                        <h2 class="text-center" style="color: #76ABAE">The Tradition</h2>
                        <p>Mr. Saman Mangala, the founder and CEO of MAL Organic, is a person with decades of experience as an organic consultant to many of the big agriculture and food manufacturing business names in Sri Lanka. During his years as an organic consultant, Mr. Saman Mangala became aware of two things. One, there are many systemic problems in organic food production as a business in this industry. And two, organic food production has been central in Sri Lankan agriculture for a long, long time. In fact, before the “Open Economy Policy” adopted in Sri Lanka in 1977, organic food production was synonymous with agriculture in our country. The only thing was that nobody called it “Organic food”. It was just “Food”.</p>

                        <p>Back then, farmers were more concerned about the high quality of their product than the high yield. The traditional methods used in farming, dating back hundreds and hundreds of years, fall within the organic standards established today. From fertilization to pest control, everything was organic. For example, one popular method of fertilizing was to allow a tall tree to grow in the middle of the paddy field to attract bats. Bat droppings then acted as a natural fertilizer for the crop. Natural predators were the main method used in pest control.</p>

                        <h2 class="text-center" style="color: #643843">The Painful Truth</h2>
                        <p>But these traditional organic methods became less and less popular as the demand for high quantity trumped the demand for high quality or concern for the environment in recent times. Then, when the term “Organic” became popular again, big food manufacturers adopted that term and hired specialists to make the product more organic (in the eye of the consumer). But the painful truth was many of the organizations were woefully unprepared for the undertaking and the term “Organic” was used to keep up appearances only. In that era, the laws and policies were too vague on the term organic, and companies exploited this to mislead consumers. That was a blow to the integrity of the organic standards.</p>

                        <p>Observing this was the main reason that drove Mr. Mangala to start his own company. A company true to our heritage, true to the term Organic, and true to our customers. A company that combines traditional values with international standards. A company that not only fulfills the customers' wishes but also promotes and honors a beautiful agricultural heritage, a better lifestyle, and a better world.</p>

                        <h2 class="text-center" style="color: #4F6F52">Finally, MAL Organic</h2>
                        <p>MAL Organic was born in 2010. We are manufacturers and exporters of true organic foods. We are a combination of a team of young administrators, dedicated workers, and traditional farmers with the supervision and leadership of Mr. Saman Mangala. We started our journey with mainly Organic Virgin Coconut oil, and after less than ten years, we have expanded our portfolio to include all coconut-based food products, traditional spices, essential oils, and other food items. Now, we are trusted suppliers to not only direct customers from around the world but also to organic food distributors in several countries. The EU, UK, New Zealand, UAE, India, and Japan are some examples.</p>

                        <p>We at MAL Organic and our two brother companies in the UK (Avonra Natural) and in Malaysia (CF Wealthy Naturals) bring you the best of Sri Lankan tradition and international standards to your home in our products.</p>
